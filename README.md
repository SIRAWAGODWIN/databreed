#Global Analysis â€” GDP & COVID-19 Impact 
-- Task 9
Task 3
A high death rate is likely to cause higher economic disruptions due to covid lockdowns, loss of labour/HR, and huge health spending by governments. 
This will inturn affect the gdp of the countries negatively. This is because the massive deaths impacted the labour market negatively, which inturn affected prices of goods and services.
as there was high demand and low supply of goods and services.
The UK, Belgium, Italy, France, and the Netherlands have the highest death rates of more than 10%, suggesting covid had a great impact on there population (confirmed deaths) and 
economy (massive gdp growth percentage drop).

Task 4
There was a direct correlation between covid deaths and gdp fall because countries with more  deaths tend increased there health care budget and this was done mostly through 
huge foreighn debt which tends to have a negative impact on the gdp. 
Loss of skilled labour also impacted the production of goods and services hence impacting the  gdp negatively.

Task 5
This task was aimed at finding countries that are very rich but did not have extremely high COVID death rates, or countries that had very high COVID death rates but are not
among the richest.
Rich Countries with high GDP per capita often translates to better healthcare systems, more capacity for lockdowns, better digital infrastructure (remote work), and more resources 
for vaccination.(Qatar, Luxembourg, Singapore, Iceland, Australia, Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, Ireland)
Poor countries with high covid deaths reflect poor health infrastructure to help reduce deaths or even administer vaccines and loss of limited skilled labour to help with service
delivery and product manufacturing.(Brazil, Mexico, India, Peru, Iran, Colombia, South Africa, Pakistan)

Task 6
All WHO regions showed a negative average GDP growth, meaning that on average, Most countries experienced economic contraction.
the data from this task can help determine, the most affected regions vs the least affected regions and to determine which regins need more financial support and to adopt 
policies from countries with high avarage gdp growth.

Task 7 
This task helped combine the impact of covid death in relation to the gdp per capita, Which enabled us to get a better overview of how various economies performed. 
Larger economies like the United States and United Kingdom, were the most affected in relation to the economic impact score

Task 8
This task enabled us to fill in the missing data and information thas created bias results to some level, doing this help reduce The mismatch between GDP and COVID data highlights
global inequalities in data Placeholder records, with 0 deaths cases ensure that analysis does not unfairly exclude these countries from regional or global aggregates. 
Filling in the missing data helps give a less skewed data, that was likely to be miss interpreted by potential investors or economic analysts.
